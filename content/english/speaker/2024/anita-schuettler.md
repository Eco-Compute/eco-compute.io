I work as a Green Coding consultant with IT companies of different sizes.

Turning e-commerce from being part of the problem to becoming part of the solution - that's my mission!

ðŸ‘‰ As a computer scientist, I work on making Green Coding and GreenOps the new normal of software development.

ðŸ‘‰ As a Circular Economy expert, I work on bringing the Circular Economy into e-commerce in a smart, convenient and attractive way.

ðŸ‘‰ As an agile sustainability strategist, I work on helping companies find their own step-by-step way to a successful sustainable business model.

Years of IT and sustainability expertise meet entrepreneurial thinking to create digital solutions for the future of e-commerce.
