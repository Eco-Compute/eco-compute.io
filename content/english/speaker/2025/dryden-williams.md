I'm the Co-Founder of CarbonRunner, a climate-tech startup focused on reducing the emissions of cloud computing by shifting workloads in real-time to lower-carbon regions. 

With a background in software development and love for making things. CarbonRunner has been an evolution of many years of trial and error, a mix of my love for the planet and my tech skills. 

When I'm not coding away and pushing for a more sustainable web, I love to travel, surf and write.
