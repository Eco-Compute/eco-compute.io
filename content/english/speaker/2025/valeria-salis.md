Software Developer with a hybrid background and way too many interests, Iâ€™ve been passionate about technology since I can remember. I enrolled in Music Computer Science at the University, and during those years, I discovered web development, which I fell in love with. A particular sensibility led me to become passionate about the environmental impact of tech.
