As a Green IT Consultant, I strive to design efficient software systems holistically - from conception to development and operation.

My main focus is on optimizing cloud environments, DevOps environments and Java-based applications. Minimalism shapes me a lot, which helps me to lead an environmentally friendly lifestyle and provides the basis for implementing and operating systems in the most cost-efficient and ecologically sustainable way possible.

In iSAQB architecture training courses (GREEN advanced module), I regularly provide my expertise, particularly on the aspects of measurement and efficient operation.

In my spare time, I am involved in animal rights activism and I am a passionate trail runner who enjoys running through nature.
