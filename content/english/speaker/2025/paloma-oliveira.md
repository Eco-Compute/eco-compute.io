Engaged in the critical exploration of the intersections of technology, art, and socio-ecological justice, Paloma works as a community-driven developer and advocate for free and open-source software. She is an organizer with PyLadies Berlin, a board member of the Python Software Verband, and a co-founder of Zentrum f√ºr Netzkunst. Currently part of the Sovereign Tech Agency, she contributes to defining critical open digital infrastructure for European sovereignty. In her own practice, she explores ways of building technologies that center autonomy, equity, and care - also beyond the human.
