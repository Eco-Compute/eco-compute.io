I am a Fullstack Software Engineer with a mission to deliver impactful products through high-quality, maintainable software. Specialized in web technologies, particularly React and Typescript, I enjoy crafting solutions that combine both technical excellence and user value. I'm passionate about sustainability, driven by the urgency of the climate crisis. As I expand my expertise in Green IT, I am exploring sustainable software practices and aim to integrate these principles into my projects.

Outside of coding, I love reconnecting with nature through camping, biking and hiking.
