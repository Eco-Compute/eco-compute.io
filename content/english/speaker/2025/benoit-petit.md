I'm on of the co-founders of Hubblo a study office specialized in environmental effects of the Tech industry.

As such I've worked on several studies regarding datacenters consumptions (energy/water/land use) and their environmental impacts, both for the public and the private sector.

Previously I was a systems engineer, so I've worked in datacenters as an IT practitioner as well for about 10 years.

I'm also an open-source developer and a contributor to the Boavizta non-profit organization, producing digital commons for a better environmental impact assessment and action in tech.
