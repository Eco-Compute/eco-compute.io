I have been a software engineer for more than 10 years. In the last 7 years I have been working together with foryouandyourcustomers Vienna in supporting companies in b2b and b2c on their digitalisation journey of internal processes and online presence.
After completing two certifications (from Climatebase and One point five academy) on climate studies and corporate sustainability, I have been active in the climate tech as well. My work in the climate tech space focuses on providing consultancy and expertise for startups on how software solutions can be planned and support their teams into building their first MVP.

My passion topic and area of expertise lies currently in the touching points between software engineering, architecture and the environmental impact of software products.
