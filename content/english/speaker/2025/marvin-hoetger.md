As sustainability manager, my goal is not only to practice sustainability internally, but also to firmly anchor it in our products. Hosting can have a large ecological footprint, and this is exactly where we come in. From energy-efficient measures in the data center to regional projects and our mobility concept.

But sustainable products cannot be created alone. We want to actively involve our customers. Through transparent communication, features that facilitate optimization, and joint initiatives that reduce the digital carbon footprint.

This is how we create real added value for our customers, our company, and the environment.
