## Why

ecoCompute is more than a conference ‚Äî it‚Äôs a catalyst for sustainable transformation in the tech industry. 

As we explore the future of Green Software and Hardware, we are equally committed to ensuring that our own event is designed and executed with the lowest possible environmental impact.

<br>

## How

ecoCompute is organised under the funding framework *‚ÄúSustainable Meetings Berlin‚Äù* by visitBerlin.  
Our event planning follows the official **Sustainable Event Scorecard**, evaluating and optimising areas such as:

- **Venue & Energy Efficiency**  
- **Circular Catering & Waste Reduction**  
- **Mobility & Accessibility**  
- **Resource-Conscious Production & Signage**  
- **Social Responsibility & Local Engagement**  

Every supplier and process is carefully selected based on transparent sustainability criteria.

<br>

## Measuring and Offsetting Our Carbon Footprint

Even with responsible planning, every event leaves a footprint. 

That‚Äôs why ecoCompute tracks and offsets all unavoidable emissions with [atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/), using their official [Event Industry CO‚ÇÇ Calculator](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/co2-eventcalculator/). 

<br>

## What We Offset

| Emission Source | Method of Calculation | Offset via |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Energy, logistics & on-site operations | atmosfair Event CO‚ÇÇ analysis | atmosfair-certified climate projects |
| Food & Catering | atmosfair Event CO‚ÇÇ analysis | atmosfair-certified climate projects |
| Server Hosting & Digital Services | <u>[Green Coding Solutions](https://www.green-coding.io/)</u> | atmosfair-certified climate projects |

The estimated emissions per attendee is <b>53,5 kg of CO‚ÇÇ equivalent</b>. These figures do not include travelling. 

Our full CO‚ÇÇ report will be published after the event for full transparency.  

<br>

## Responsible Travel

We actively encourage all attendees to choose **train or public transport** when possible. To make sustainable travel the default, ecoCompute provides:

* **Public transport guidance & ticket recommendations**  
* **Bike-friendly venue access**  
* **No-flight speaker policy for in-country speakers.**

All estimated speaker travel emissions will be **calculated after the event and compensated fully**.

<br>

## Continuous Improvement

Starting in 2025 after each edition of ecoCompute, we will evaluate our impact and publicly share:

* A **Sustainability Report** with CO‚ÇÇ figures  
* **Lessons learned & new commitments** for future editions  
* Opportunities for **community collaboration**

*Our goal is clear: make ecoCompute one of Europe‚Äôs most climate-conscious tech conferences.*
