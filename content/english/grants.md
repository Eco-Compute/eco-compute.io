## ecoCompute Opportunity Grants

ecoCompute is dedicated to widening participation and ensuring inclusivity. To support this goal, we're offering opportunity grants for individuals who might otherwise face challenges in attending the conference. These grants are intended to assist with various costs associated with conference participation, such as travel, accommodation, and registration fees.

We encourage you to apply for these opportunity grants, especially if attending ecoCompute would be financially challenging. While our desire is to support all applicants, our resources are limited, and our focus is on achieving the greatest possible impact within these constraints.

The grant selection process is designed with several key objectives:

- Facilitating a diverse and global gathering, prioritizing those who can bring unique perspectives to ecoCompute , particularly speakers and tutorial presenters.
- Enhancing diversity at the conference. Our grants target members of under-represented or marginalized groups in the tech community, acknowledging the extra barriers they might face in attending.
- Assessing the potential impact of the grant on both the recipient and their broader community. This includes factors like local community involvement, the social impact of the applicant's work, and their access to other conferences.

The application deadline is October 1st 2025, 23:59 UTC. We aim to notify applicants shortly after the application period ends. Please note, to be considered for a grant, applications must be submitted by the deadline. Speakers are automatically entitled to a ticket.

## Encouragement to Apply

We understand some might hesitate to apply, wondering if they should. Remember:

- Previous conference attendance or grant receipt does not disqualify you.
- Limited experience with the conference's focus area is not a barrier.
- Concerns about taking resources from others are understandable, but we encourage you to apply anyway.
- Doubts about deserving a grant? Please apply â€“ you deserve this opportunity.
- While we can't guarantee a grant for everyone due to limited funds, we urge those unsure to apply. Grant recipient identities are kept confidential unless explicit permission is given to share them.

For inquiries, please contact us at info@eco-compute.io.

Remember, the application window closes on October 1st 2025, 23:59 UTC!
