# Community Track @ ecoCompute 2025  
*A space for collaboration, critical reflection & creativity in sustainable technology*

## Call for Speakers Now Open!

For the first time, **ecoCompute** will host a **Community Track**, a dedicated space spotlighting diverse voices from civil society, environmental activism, grassroots tech, and research.

We aim to **amplify your voices**, help raise awareness, and foster meaningful connections. This space is for **productive dialogue, critical reflection**, and **collaborative solutions** toward a sustainable digital future.

---

## Why a Community Track?

The **climate crisis** and the **digital revolution** are deeply intertwined. You may already know that the **Information and Communications Sector** is responsible for **1.8–2.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions**, which is comparable to the aviation industry.

There’s an urgent need for **interdisciplinary and intersectional approaches** to ensure tech is sustainable.

**Supported by the German Federal Environment Agency**, the Community Track at ecoCompute 2025 provides a platform where sustainability intersects with technology, society, and grassroots movements.

After all, tackling the ecological impacts of digitalization is not just a technical issue, it’s social and political.
