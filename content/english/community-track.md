### Why a Community Track?

<br>


The **climate crisis** and the **digital revolution** are deeply intertwined. You may already know that the **Information and Communications Sector** is responsible for **1.5–4% of global greenhouse gas emissions**, which is comparable to the aviation industry. [1]

There’s an urgent need for **interdisciplinary and intersectional approaches** to ensure tech is sustainable.

**Supported by the German Federal Environment Agency** (Umweltbundesamt) and the **BMUKN** *, the Community Track at ecoCompute 2025 provides a platform where sustainability intersects with technology, society, and grassroots movements.

After all, tackling the ecological impacts of digitalization is not just a technical issue, it’s social and political.
