### Description

Sustainability in software development is not just about code. Decisions made throughout the entire software lifecycle—from requirements to UX and architecture to operations—shape the ecological footprint of digital systems.

This workshop provides practical examples of how sustainability can be integrated into everyday development work. It starts with a keynote speech featuring proven methods and examples for requirements, UX design, architecture, development, testing, and operations. Participants then work in small teams on micro-challenges, i.e., measures that can be applied immediately in software development (e.g., backlog management, reviews, UX design, build and deployment context, etc.). A special focus is placed on collaboration within the company: How can sales, product owners, developers, and management work together early on to develop software sustainably? 

Those who wish to do so can then test the developed challenge in everyday project work for four weeks. The teams document their experiences internally or publicly, for example on LinkedIn, thereby creating visibility, involving other colleagues, and anchoring sustainable action in the organization.
