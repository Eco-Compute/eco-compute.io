### Description
The Blue Angel for Software (**Blauer Engel f√ºr Software - DE-UZ 215**) is the official eco label for software products from the german federal environment agency (**Umweltbundesamt**).

In this hands-on workshop we will walk you through the practical side of the certification process, which documents you need to procure and how to set-up the measurement so you can get the Blue Angel for your software.

The workshop's motto is **"How to get the Blue Angel for Software in less than 3 hours"** and will have the following agenda:

- We use a simple Client-Server demo application (the most used category in the Blue Angel software categories)
- We show how it can be dockerized. Basically a simple compose file that starts a web server and serves the html/js/css files.
- We show how you can codify the needed "Nutzungs-Szenarien" from the Blue Angel for applications that have already received the Blue Angel and then craft a mint file on our own.
- We discuss what the needed core features are for measurment tools
- We then show how you can use Playwright to write some simple scenarios.
- We then show how you can measure all the needed parameters required for the certification
- We then go through all the documents you need to hand in and explain them.
- We will present the final files generated and how to hand them in to the certification body (RAL)
- While we do this we talk about all the additional things like link to documentation etc ..
- Q&A
