You might have already read our [Sustainability Commitment](/sustainability).

Here we have compiled some recommendations if you want to contribute to making ecoComput even more sustainable.


### **Choose Climate-Friendly Travel**

Getting to the venue often causes the biggest CO₂ footprint — so smart choices here make the greatest difference.

Best options (in this order):

1. Take the train or long-distance bus — Fast, comfortable, and often cheaper than flying.  
2. Combine remote & local travel — If flying is unavoidable, consider using public transport or bike-sharing in Berlin instead of taxis.  
3. Pool your travel with other attendees\! You can ask us and we connect.

Pro Tip: Deutsche Bahn offers *Super Sparpreis \+ Sparpreis* tickets when booked early — plan ahead\!

### **Stay Sustainably**

Prefer hotels that are GreenSign, EU Ecolabel, or Sustainable Meetings Berlin certified.  
We will publish partner recommendations shortly — but meanwhile, search for accommodation with:

* Renewable energy or energy-saving policies  
* Local/seasonal breakfast options instead of buffet overproduction  
* Accessible location near public transport

### **Eat Thoughtfully**

Our catering is already vegan/vegetarian only and low waste — and you can further support that idea:

* Avoiding food waste (take only what you’ll enjoy)  
* Bringing your own reusable bottle or cup 
* Choosing vegetarian or vegan options also when travelling.

### **Pack Smart & Low Waste**

Consider bringing:

* Refillable bottle / coffee mug  
* Small tote bag instead of collecting   
* Notebook or tablet instead of printed materials

We intentionally limit conference merchandise — please only take what you will *actually use long-term*. Please consider returning the provided Laynards at the registration counter after ecoCompute.

### **Respect the Venue Sustainability System**

Our venue uses separated waste bins — please follow the signage.

If you're unsure where something belongs: ask the staff. They’ll be happy to guide you.

### **Support the Community**

Sustainability is also social. You can contribute by:

* Engaging respectfully with fellow attendees  
* Sharing your own green software and hardware best practices  
* Highlighting responsible vendors on social media (\#ecoCompute2025)

### **Your Feedback Matters**

We’re constantly improving our sustainable event strategy — and your ideas can help us do better.

After the conference, you’ll receive a quick sustainability feedback form. Please take 2 minutes to fill it in — it helps us shape and improve future editions.


Thank you for helping make **ecoCompute** a **climate-conscious conference**.  
Together, we turn Green IT from theory into reality.
