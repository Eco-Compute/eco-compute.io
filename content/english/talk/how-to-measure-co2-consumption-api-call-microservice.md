Have you ever wondered how much CO2 is consumed by a particular API call of your microservices? 
Then this talk is for you! 

I will show you how OpenTelemetry can be used to collect the necessary data to calculate the CO2 consumption for each API call of your microservices. Since OpenTelemetry is compatible with a wide range of data storage and analysis tools, you can use open source tools like Prometheus and Grafana to build dashboards or alerts based on the collected data. 

I will conclude the talk with a demo showing a CO2 consumption dashboard for each API call of Java-based microservices written in Quarkus and Spring.
