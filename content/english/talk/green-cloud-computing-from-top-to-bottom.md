By leveraging efficient infrastructure management, innovative technologies and platform engineering as centre of excellence we are able to define a strategic approach to minimising the environmental impact of digital systems. Let's explore which practices, such as containerisation/Kubernetes, distributed ledger systems (ICP), and cloud computing, can improve resource utilisation, reduce energy consumption, and lower overall carbon emissions.

In this talk, I will show you why and how you need to implement sustainable practices from architecture and procurement; How this will become reality in the implementation of the CICD, infrastructure scaleability and the synergy between application and platform; and I will highlight the role of platform engineering and the mindset of platforms as a product in reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmental sustainability.
