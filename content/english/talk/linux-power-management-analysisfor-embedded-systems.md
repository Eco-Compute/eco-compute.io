This presentation will discuss in detail the pitfalls from software design to
implementation of a Linux embedded product in order to develop a power
efficient device. The topic will be approached from an analytical point of
view, as this provides the basis for making improvements in the first place.

The presentation gives concrete insights on how to identify wakeups, the
impact of scaling governors and many other subsystems of the kernel. The talk
is intermixed by numerous practical examples, which should enable the listener
to autonomously analyze and optimize the power consumption for complex
embedded systems.

The talk has no prerequisites for the audience. Topics such as scheduling or
CPU frequency governors are introduced in the talk. Of course, the listener
should have a basic understanding of a Linux system and at least a basic
understanding of concepts such as processes and interrupts.

Even if the talk focuses on an embedded system, the knowledge provided can,
with a few exceptions, also be transferred to a server system.
