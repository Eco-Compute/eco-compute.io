The talk uses a real-life example to show how AI systems can cause less environmental impact with the same performance. Tried and tested tools will be presented to reduce the environmental impact of AI systems. The focus is explicitly not on general methods for green software, but on specific fields of action from the AI sector. 

After the presentation, the audience will have a general overview of the relevant fields of action in the area of sustainable AI and will be able to name the most effective and low-threshold methods. The talk is aimed at developers who have a basic understanding of the development of AI systems. However, the content is also understandable without specific AI experience.
