In this talk you will hear details about particular energy saving techniques that apply to modern cloud and on prem-software.

Techniques looked at in this talk include:
- Identifying which key areas to look at first in containerized applications (Build / Cold-Boot / Runtime / Network)
- Profiling of energy hotspots in containerized applications
- Implications of different power settings in modern CPU architectures not only on energy, but also on carbon emissions of software products
- Easily identifying carbon savings through underutilization of resources in evolving codebases / CI-CD integrated
- Comparing CO2 savings of architecture changes 
- Low hanging fruits / quick wins for cabon optimizations

The techniques will be looked with concrete examples of public open source projects to reproduce / replay the cases.
