How much power a computer consumes and what emissions are generated by hardware equipment in organizations also depends largely on the software on the devices. If hardware requirements are excessively high, hardware is often taken out of service prematurely. 

In this case, we speak of software-related obsolescence. The Blue Angel for resource- and energy-efficient software products is the first environmental label in the world to address this problem and focus on environmental criteria for software. In this presentation, the latest scientific findings in the field of green IT/green software will be presented and best practice examples for sustainable procurement and use of software products will be provided.
