At Plan A, it is our daily business to measure and reduce our clients' emissions. However, we are also a tech company ourselves and face the same challenges in this space, such as blind spots in IT emissions.

To lead by example, Plan A has launched its Green IT initiative in 2024. Our goal is clear: we want to know exactly how many emissions our service generates and aim to reduce those as much as possible.

What setbacks have we had to overcome? How do you make the most of limited resources? And how to foster a culture of sustainability in the engineering department?
