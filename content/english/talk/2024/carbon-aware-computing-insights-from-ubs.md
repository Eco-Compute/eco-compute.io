In this session I will share the learnings from the UBS project I have been working on as Technical Program Manager. 

We will tab into challenges like integrating carbon aware time shifting into existing systems and the relevance of business impact driven by the outcomes. We will also discuss the perspective of cloud service providers on Carbon Aware Computing and why it is not a mainstream practice as well as opportunities in smart Edge environments. 

This session assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts of carbon aware computing and will dive into grid specific mechanisms, which are relevant understanding opportunities of these practices to decarbonize the grid.
