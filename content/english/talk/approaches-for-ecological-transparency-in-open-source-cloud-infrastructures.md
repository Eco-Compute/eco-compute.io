Open source cloud infrastructures are inherently transparent about their internal workings, making them attractive for security and privacy sensitive domains. 

But what about their transparency regarding the energy metrics of these infrastructures? 

The talk will provide an overview of which data can be collected and made available and which software tools can be used to determine this data. It also looks at how these tools can be integrated into an open source cloud stack based on OpenStack and Kubernetes. 

Additionally, the talk addresses optimization options based on energy metrics and concludes with an outlook on further work in this domain.
