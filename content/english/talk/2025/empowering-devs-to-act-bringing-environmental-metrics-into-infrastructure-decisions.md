As sustainability becomes a strategic concern in cloud architecture, developers and DevOps teams need access to clear and actionable environmental metrics. In this talk, we will explore how Scaleway's Environmental Footprint Calculator helps engineering teams make infrastructure decisions that are not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly, drawing on real-world usage data regarding carbon emissions, energy consumption, and water consumption. Participants will discover how to integrate environmental insights into daily DevOps workflows to reduce impact without compromising performance.

As the technology sector grapples with its growing environmental footprint, the responsibility to act is shifting from high-level corporate strategies to the daily decisions made by engineers and DevOps teams. But how can they make greener choices when the data is often invisible, complex, or unavailable?

In this talk, we'll dive deep into Scaleway's journey of building a transparent and actionable cloud. We will introduce our Environmental Footprint Calculator, a first-of-its-kind tool that provides engineering teams with granular, real-world data on the environmental impact of their infrastructureâ€”including carbon emissions, energy consumption, and water usage.

This presentation will go beyond theory, using concrete examples and key insights from our data to empower participants to make a tangible difference. You will learn:
  - How technical choices, such as selecting the right Availability Zone based on its energy mix, can have a multiplying effect on your infrastructure's carbon footprint.
  - The impact of architectural decisions, from choosing managed services over bare metal to implementing autoscaling, and how they can lead to significant reductions.
  - How our API and upcoming dashboard enable the automation of environmental reporting, allowing you to integrate sustainability metrics seamlessly into your daily DevOps workflows and continuous delivery pipelines.

Join us to discover how Scaleway is helping the tech community make performance, cost-efficiency, and environmental responsibility inseparable from the start.
