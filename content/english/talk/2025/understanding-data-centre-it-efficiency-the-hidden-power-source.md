The digital infrastructure industry is facing massive growth in power demand to support expanding traditional IT and new AI training and inference infrastructures. While the industry is focused on building new power capacity, power demand reduction through the deployment and proper utilisation of highly efficient IT infrastructure is largely ignored.

This session will discuss strategies and case studies that optimise IT infrastructure energy performance and minimise the energy, space, and cooling capacity required to deliver a given set of workloads. Future energy consumption can be reduced by 25% to 50% by recovering available power capacity and reducing planned demand.

We will discuss tools and metrics needed to manage the IT infrastructure and real case studies of companies that have consolidated existing infrastructure or refreshed and consolidated to new infrastructure. The industry has huge opportunities to run the IT infrastructure more efficiently and drive circularity.

This session will discuss strategies and case studies that optimise IT infrastructure energy performance and minimise the energy, space, and cooling capacity required to deliver a given set of workloads.

We will discuss and present tools and metrics needed to manage the IT infrastructure and real case studies of companies that have consolidated existing infrastructure or refreshed and consolidated to new infrastructure.

We will present 2 case studies with specific examples on how to address efficiency using clear data and analysis.
