When we think of making software more sustainable, we often jump straight to efficient code or green hosting. But what if the biggest lever lies much earlierâ€”before a single line of code is written?

Requirements Engineering is our first opportunity to shape software in ways that reduce energy consumption, extend hardware lifespan, and minimize unnecessary functionality. By embedding sustainability into our requirements, we can guide design, architecture, and development decisions that favor greener outcomes.

In this session, you will get to know practical tips how you can construct your requirements engineering process and workshops with your stakeholders and use that information to achieve an energy efficient software solution.
