The ECO:DIGIT research project is developing comprehensive methods for measuring the ecological footprint of digital systems. As part of this work, we have created Leaf, an open-source solution that reports environmental impacts for providers and tenants in Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) compliant clouds.
In this talk, we will present how Leaf combines runtime metrics and data centre inventory data to calculate operational emissions and embedded emissions from the manufacturing phase, enabling holistic emissions reporting across our IaaS clouds.

Participants will gain insight into our current architecture and model, which illustrate ways to improve transparency of emissions reporting in cloud infrastructure.
