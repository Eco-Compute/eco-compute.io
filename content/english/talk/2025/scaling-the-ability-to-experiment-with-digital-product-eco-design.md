To scale eco-design practices across large teams, we will see how a large aircraft industry leader offers a self-guided experiment framework.

Product owners evaluate their products with built-in LCA tools, using metrics like CPU and storage. Users then experiment with their own scenarios to lower environmental footprints, driving community-driven adoption through hands-on discovery and peer learning.

The main challenge for sustainable digital solutions is to deliver & scale practices across very large teams: This talk explores how to to teach the right practices in large 
teams. Reality suggest rather enabling experimentation.
