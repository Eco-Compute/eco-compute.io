The CO2 Challenge is a lighthouse campaign run by the CyberForum in Karlsruhe. IT and software companies from the region have committed to reducing their software's emissions by 40%.

The adventure has been going on for a year. Here's what we've learnt.

The CO2 Challenge was launched in Karlsruhe over a year ago under the umbrella of the CyberForum. IT and software companies from the region have committed to reducing their software's emissions by 40%. A lighthouse project.

Rather than being a competition, the whole thing is a challenge, with mentoring and support provided through the network. The idea is that companies will be empowered to develop and operate climate-friendly, resource-conserving software with the support of volunteer mentors. All measures and their effects are documented, resulting in a substantial repository of best practices.

Participants include large, well-known companies such as TeamViewer, Seeburger, Telemaxx and EnBW, as well as smaller product companies such as ScriptRunner and Raumobil, and service providers such as Andrena, bluehands and Navigate. Currently, more than 20 companies are participating, with new ones joining all the time.

In this talk, Aydin (initiator and co-organiser) will present the various measures being taken by individual companies and the options available for different business areas, such as products, services and infrastructure.

The session will review the campaign so far: what challenges are companies facing? What specific problems arise in practice, and how can they be solved? Who are the drivers and who are the sceptics? How can you get started, and how do you maintain momentum?
