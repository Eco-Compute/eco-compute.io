When we talk about digitalization and sustainability, we often talk about both â€˜Green ITâ€™ and â€˜Green through ITâ€™. And in the best case scenario, when digitalization and sustainability go hand in hand, we talk about the so-called â€˜twin transitionâ€™ as a very positive trend.

But are we really being sincere when we place so much emphasis on the positive opportunities offered by digitalization?

When we talk about digitalization and sustainability, we often talk about both â€˜Green ITâ€™ and â€˜Green through ITâ€™. And in the best case scenario, when digitalization and sustainability go hand in hand, we talk about the so-called â€˜twin transitionâ€™.

The narrative that is told here is: let's invest more in digitalization so that we can drive forward the sustainability transformation. Digitalization is thus presented as the solution to becoming more sustainable. It is a narrative that paints digitalization in a very positive light. This narrative goes as far as extreme representations, such as that by Bitkom, according to which digitalization can contribute to around a quarter of Germany's 2030 climate protection targets.

And yes, we know that digitalization can make production processes more efficient, that it can contribute to dematerialisation, and that it is certainly indispensable if we want to achieve a real circular economy. Many very positive examples can be cited in this regard. And digitalization is certainly indispensable in many areas in order to enable the sustainability transformation.

Unfortunately, however, sustainability is rarely the actual purpose of digitalization. In most cases, it is about commerce and profit, and thus contributes to environmental and climate damage.

And even with digital solutions and projects where sustainability is the primary goal, the question always arises as to whether all aspects are really taken into account in the life cycle assessment. What about rebound effects, for example? They hardly ever appear in the considerations.

But what does the overall balance sheet ultimately look like? Do the positive or negative effects of digitalization outweigh each other? Or, in sustainability terminology: does digitalization have a larger handprint or a larger footprint? This presentation will attempt to look at the overall situation and thus arrive at an honest assessment.

Against this background, how can we evaluate today's approaches to â€˜Green ITâ€™ and â€˜Green through ITâ€™? What do we need to change, if anything?
