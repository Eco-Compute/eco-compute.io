Maybe we are not always honest about sustainability and digitalization. We are often very optimistic when we talk about the 'twin transformation', pointing to more efficient production procsses or the promise of a circular economy. 

But this positive narrative often omits uncomfortable truths: some critial factors like e.g the rebound effect are almost entirely ignored in our assessments.
What do we need to change to more strongly embed sustainability in digitalization?
