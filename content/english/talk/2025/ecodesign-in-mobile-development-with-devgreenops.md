The environmental impact of mobile devices extends beyond their energy use: the majority of a smartphoneâ€™s impact is caused by its manufacturing. Extending the lifespan of battery-powered devices is thus one of the most impactful actions toward digital sustainability.
This talk introduces a framework for Ecodesign in mobile development to enable longer device life, supported by a DevGreenOps approach. By understanding and optimizing app and website performance, developers can directly influence battery health, helping users keep their devices functional for longer.
This talk covers how empirical measure on physical devices allows the identification of performance issues, and helped reduces battery and network usage by half on industry use cases. On widely used applications , avoided CO2e impacts scale to the hundreds of tons. 
Whether you're a developer, product manager, or tech lead, this session will equip you with actionable strategies to reduce your software's environmental impact.

This talk covers 
- The importance of empirical measure of performance on physical devices and the selection relevant performance indicators
- The integration of sustainability in development processes to detect performance issues and regressions
- How battery and network usage have been reduced by half on widely used public-facing software, executed millions of time every year, such as the Bouygues Telecom app, the SNCF Connect app, or the Paris 2024 Olympic Games website.
