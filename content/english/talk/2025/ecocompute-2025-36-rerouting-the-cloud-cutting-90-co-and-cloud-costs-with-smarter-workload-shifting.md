In this session, weâ€™ll show how CarbonRunner shifts compute workloads in real-time to regions with the lowest COâ‚‚ intensityâ€”cutting emissions by up to 90%, reducing cloud costs, and improving resilience without disrupting developer workflows.

As 83% of data centres are located in regions with high grid carbon intensity. Compute makes up 60% of a data centreâ€™s power demandâ€”the rest is cooling. With global data centre power consumption set to double by 2030.

Weâ€™ll use live maps, real-time grid data, and production metrics to show how climate-conscious compute can be cheaper, cleaner, and more sovereign. From cost savings to climate wins, discover how smart workload shifting rewrites the economicsâ€”and emissions profileâ€”of cloud computing.

In this talk we want to highlight the Problem, Solution and Learnings & Metrics we've gathered so far from shifting the world's compute. This includes:

- Using live maps, we expose how common workloads unknowingly spike emissions by running in carbon-heavy regionsâ€”regardless of cloud provider.
- The CarbonRunner Approach: A single-line integration that shifts CI/CD and batch workloads dynamically to cleaner energy regionsâ€”cutting emissions by up to 90% while reducing cloud bills.
- Learnings & Metrics: Real production numbers: jobs shifted, tonnes of COâ‚‚ saved, and money savedâ€”plus practical trade-offs when balancing cost, carbon, and speed.
- More Resilient Cloud Operations: How dynamic shifting reduces load on stressed regions, improves redundancy, and builds resilience into your infrastructure.
- Built-in Data Sovereignty: Developers and teams retain controlâ€”choose clouds, countries, or even green energy thresholds to meet compliance and sovereignty goals.
- Not Just the Big 3: Works across hyperscalers and alternative cloudsâ€”because true sustainability means moving beyond just AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- ESG Dashboards: ready for you enterprise teams showing the impact of your GitHub Actions and savings of shifting them. 

Expect a highly visual, data-driven session that proves you can cut cloud emissions and costs today, using existing infrastructure smarterâ€”not by waiting for next-gen hardware or distant green pledges.
