The “Green IT and Green AI” guideline compiles recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of digital systems across various target groups in companies, public institutions, and research facilities. It presents practical measures and links to tools for minimizing environmental impacts, such as energy and resource consumption, in five components: digital services, data centers, networks, software, and hardware, as well as in the field of artificial intelligence. The measures range from recycling and energy-saving strategies to sufficiency-oriented approaches to AI. 

Developed by RIFS at GFZ in collaboration with partners from science and industry as part of the GreenTech Innovation Competition, the guideline invites readers to dive further into the topics of Green IT and Green AI and take first steps toward practical implementation. This presentation introduces the guideline and invites discussions on a more sustainable digital transformation.
