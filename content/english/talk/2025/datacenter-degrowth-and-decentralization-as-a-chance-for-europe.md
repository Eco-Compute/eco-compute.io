The growth of datacenters goes exponential and it consumes lots of resources.

Can we leave the explosion path and recognize the many advantages of
datacenter degrowth?

Degrowth is the concept of a planned reduction of resource consumption. The
concept is applied to datacenters in a different way.

At first we need to identify the drivers of the exponential growth and
question and remove them. Only now it makes sense to look into every layer of
an application to reduce the resource consumption.

Surprisingly we find a lot of advantages in degrowth if we think it together
with decentralisation, heating and robotics.
