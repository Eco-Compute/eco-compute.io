CarbonDB is a real time solution that maps any form of carbon emissions (operation, embodied, network) to IT infrastructure components.

The solution includes:
- Cloud machines
- On Prem machines
- Power generation (e.g. on-site solar)
- SaaS like CI/CD systems
- etc.

The talk will present how IT components can be integrated and how Dev teams and managers can derive useful information about total carbon emissions, the evolution of the carbon efficiency of software products and also optimization targets.

Also a comparison to tools like Sopht and Plan A will be done.
