Everyoneâ€™s talking about sustainable AI and energy-efficient codingâ€”but what does that really mean in practice? In this session, we move beyond the buzzwords to explore the tangible impact of coding choices on energy consumption, COâ‚‚ emissions, and cost savings.
Through a real-world use case, we compare two implementations of the same toolâ€”one built in Java, the other in Goâ€”and reveal surprising differences in power usage, carbon footprint, CPU load, memory consumption, and processing time. Youâ€™ll gain concrete numbers, actionable insights, and a deeper understanding of how smart engineering decisions can drive both sustainability and efficiency. Whether you're a developer, architect, or sustainability lead, this session will help you rethink your tech stack with the planet in mind.
