One of the big ideas of the web is that you can link to things, so when you make claims about something, you can be one click away from being able to back it up with data.

How should we be using this idea to make sustainability claims about software more credible, and discoverable?

Are there lessons from domains like accessibility, clean energy, and software supply chain security, or even finance that weâ€™re not using when we ought to be?

Chris Adams at the Green Web Foundation thinks so.

In this talk he will give an overview of how this idea has shown up in recent standardised approaches to measuring the sustainability of digital services, like the Blue Angel label, the W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines and GSF Software Carbon Intensity standards.

Heâ€™ll then outline where these ideas from other domains could be applied to make claims around sustainability easier to understand and trust, why 'webby' claims are a good idea, and introduce a project, carbon.txt built around this idea.

In this talk Chris Adams, the Director of Technology and Policy at the Green Web
