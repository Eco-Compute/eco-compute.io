The ecoCompute conference focuses on technical solutions for reducing the resource consumption of digital infrastructures. However, while innovative hardware efficiency features and green software concepts exist, their widespread adoption, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often fails to materialise. This presentation addresses the critical gap between technological possibility and practical implementation: the lack of skills development.

We present the NABIT (Sustainable Education in IT Training and Continuing Education) research project, which focuses on the challenges of twin transformation â€“ the simultaneous design of the digital and sustainable transition. IT is both a driver of resource consumption and a central solution provider through green IT (efficient infrastructure) and green IS (sustainable business processes). The NABIT project analyses why this potential remains untapped.

**1. Introduction: The challenge of twin transformation in IT**
Digital transformation is accelerating resource consumption, while at the same time regulatory requirements (e.g. CSRD) are forcing companies to become more sustainable. This "twin transformation" presents IT with a dilemma: it is part of the problem (energy consumption, emissions) and at the same time the key to the solution. We highlight the two core strategic areas:
*   **Green IT:** How can we design IT infrastructures and software in a resource-efficient manner?
*   **Green IS:** How do we use information systems to support sustainable business processes?
There is often a gap between the efficiency functions in hardware and their actual use in software, which is a core topic of ecoCompute.

**2. The problem: the skills gap as a key obstacle to implementation**
Our NABIT project identifies the biggest hurdle to comprehensive sustainable digitalisation not in the technology itself, but in the lack of skills among professionals. SMEs in particular lack the resources and know-how to meet sustainability requirements. Current IT training regulations and curricula only cover topics such as green coding, hardware life cycle management and sustainable data management in a rudimentary way. Without qualified specialists, even the best tools and methods remain ineffective.

**3. Our approach: The NABIT project â€“ education as an enabler**
We present the practical approach of the NABIT joint project, which closes this gap:
*   **Analysis (WP 1 & 2): Systematic survey of sustainability-related IT skills requirements in SMEs through curriculum analyses and expert workshops.
*   **Development (WP 3 & 4):** Creation of modular, skills-based educational modules and freely accessible Open Educational Resources (OER) covering topics such as energy-efficient architecture, circular economy (refurbishment) and sustainable IT procurement.
*   **Transfer (WP 5 & 6):** Development of a corporate consulting concept to transfer knowledge directly to companies and promote sustainable cultural change, turning "those affected" into "those involved".

**4. Practical relevance and significance for the ecoCompute community**
This presentation is not a purely academic treatise, but rather a "success story from a real project" in the making. We will share initial lessons learned from our collaboration with companies and educational institutions. The presentation offers concrete added value for the ecoCompute target group:
*   **For developers and architects:** Insights into why their green features are not catching on in practice and how educational initiatives can increase demand and understanding for them.
*   **For decision-makers and data centre professionals:** Understanding that investments in sustainable technology must be complemented by investments in employee training in order to achieve a return on investment.
*   **For the entire community:** A new approach that integrates social and educational policy dimensions into a primarily technical debate, thereby building a bridge to the conference's "Community Track".

**Takeaways for the audience:**
1.  The twin transformation can only succeed if technological innovation and skills development go hand in hand.
2.  You will gain insights into the specific sustainability skills gaps among IT professionals in SMEs.
3.  You will learn about practical approaches (OER, modular qualification) to promote a culture of sustainability in your own company or network and increase acceptance of green technologies.
