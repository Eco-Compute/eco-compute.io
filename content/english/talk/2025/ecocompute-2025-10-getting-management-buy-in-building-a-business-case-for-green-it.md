The goal of this talk is to present an actionable strategy for securing budget for a Green IT project by demonstrating its environmental, financial, and operational value, while positioning it as a critical part of the organizationâ€™s broader sustainability goals and adhering to wider regulations such as EDF and CSRD regulations.

Far too often, IT departments pursue sustainability initiatives that operate in isolation, disconnected from the companyâ€™s overarching sustainability strategy. As a result, these efforts are often voluntary, lack visibility, and fail to gain the priority they deserve. IT teams have yet to establish a compelling business case that secures the necessary budgets for Green IT initiatives. I have seen such great work being done, but there seems to be a gap in communication between IT and sustainability departments. I too was on a project that was to shed light on how even websites have a carbon footprint, failed at getting the buy-in from management, so the project was killed.

To elevate these efforts, we must align Green IT projects with regulatory frameworks such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), ensuring they are recognized as essential and strategic.
