The talk consists of two parts:

1. Contradictions/areas of tension in the field of sustainability at a web host. Establishing sustainability is not always a sure-fire success. There is no right or wrong when it comes to the following points. We want to discuss this with you.

    - Green hosting vs. carbon-aware computing
    - AI hosting – and sustainable too?
    - CO2 footprint calculator: greenwashing or opportunity?
    - Long hardware use vs. performance promises
    - etc.
This part will be held in English 🇬🇧

2. Energy efficiency and challenges in a 15-year-old data center: What measures were already taken into account during construction and what technology has been renewed over the years? What improvements and measures contribute to energy efficiency?

    - Heat pump powered by warm water from the data center's air conditioning system.
    - Renewal of air conditioning units with integration of a free cooler.
    - Energy optimization by increasing cold aisle temperatures.
    - Replacement of UPS systems.
    - Power peaks in the data center due to cron jobs.
    - etc.

This part will be held in German 🇩🇪
