Have you ever wondered how much CO2 is emitted by a particular API call of your microservices?
Then this talk is for you!

I will show you how OpenTelemetry can be used to collect the necessary data to calculate the CO2 emissions for each API call of your microservices. Since OpenTelemetry is compatible with a wide range of data storage and analysis tools, you can use open source tools like Prometheus and Grafana to build dashboards or alerts based on the collected data.

I will conclude the talk with a demo showing a CO2 emissions dashboard for each API call of Java-based microservices written in Quarkus and Spring.
