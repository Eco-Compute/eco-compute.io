  content : "ecoCompute was born out of the necessity to <b>bring sustainability in the digital realm into action</b>.<br> <br>
  Sustainability knowledge and also efforts are often siloed in specific technical domains without reaching the people who can make use of it.

- We have good processor efficiency features, but they are often only known to the hardware developers

- We have good software techniques to shift load to where the sun is shining, but data centers do not enable them

- We have good software algorithms but the hardware does not optimally support their implementation

- We have people with a lot of sustainability knowledge in tech, but they have no dedicated platform to connect and talk
<br>
<br>

With ecoCompute we have create a platform for delivering this type of knowledge by inviting professionals from the often
  separate domains hardware, software, and data centers to share knowledge and overcome implementation hurdles.
  <br>
  <br>

  The conference features dedicated tracks, always featuring a topic in an intersectional manner. It is futher supported through
  high-value workshops, where attendees can deep-dive into topics with hands-on experiences.
