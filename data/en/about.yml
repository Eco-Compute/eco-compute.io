  content : "EcoCompute aims to address the current issue of energy and resource consumption of digital infrastructures with a new approach.
  <br><br>
    We want to bring together hardware design, software development, data center operations and also IT project planning to understand intersectional barriers and implementation hurdles.
    <br><br>
    So far environmental concerns have only been addressed in siloed domains or solutions have been suggested that could not be implemented due to privacy or client concerns.
    <br><br>
    EcoCompute aspires to surface new working solutions and advance sustainability in digital technology.
